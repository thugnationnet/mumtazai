## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. User Describes App

"Create an admin dashboard with sidebar navigation - Dashboard, Users, Settings, and Analytics pages. Each page should show different content with stats."

### 2. AI Generates WORKING Code

The AI creates React code with useState for navigation:
- Sidebar buttons have onClick handlers
- Main content renders different components based on state
- Everything is functional, not just visual

### 3. Live Preview = Working App

- Click "Dashboard" → Dashboard content appears
- Click "Users" → User management appears
- Click "Settings" → Settings panel appears
- Everything actually works - no dead buttons!
